# KnifeSql 🔪

### The Surgical Database Toolkit for DevToys

Database work often requires jumping between multiple heavy, resource-draining applications. KnifeSql is a comprehensive extension for DevToys designed to bring the most essential database utility features directly into your workspace—lightweight, fast, and offline.
Just as DevToys is the "Swiss Army Knife" for developers, KnifeSql is the specialized blade designed for DB manipulations.
